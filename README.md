# Type Error in TypeScript Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when attempting to perform arithmetic operations on incompatible data types.  The `add` function is defined to take two numbers as input and return their sum. However, the function is called with a string and a number, leading to a type error.

The solution demonstrates how to resolve this by either type-checking the input parameters or by explicitly converting the string to a number before performing addition.
